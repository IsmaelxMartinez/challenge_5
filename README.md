### explain how components, props and state are work specifically in the Tic Tac toe app ###

- Specifically in this project state is being used to hold the value of all squares and if the x square is next or not. What i mean by value of all squares is when you want to manage state across all squares the easiest way to do it is to pass it through as props in the parent component. also using props to pass a handle click function.
- The components allows me to connect parts of my app but it also allows me to lift the state of other components, letting me control a component data with another component.
- Props allows me to dynamically pass data across components and dynamically change the state of components. Also allowing me ot pas funcitons across comonents such as handle click functions.
